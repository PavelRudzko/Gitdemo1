I will occupy
i m help you die 
End of passion play, crumbling away

I'm your source of self-destruction

Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear

Leading on your deaths construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need

You're dedicated 
How I'm killing you

Come crowling faster 
obey your master
